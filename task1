## Scenario Details
You are hired to set up a network for a medium-sized office. Your tasks are:

### Allocated Network
- **Base Network:** `192.168.50.0/24`

### Requirements

2. **Document Your Subnets**:
   For each department, provide the following:
   - **Subnet Mask**
   - **Network Address**
   - **Broadcast Address**
   - **Usable IP Range**

3. **Validation**:
   - Verify your configuration using:
     - The solutions in `solutions/subnetting-task.md`.
     - The Excel validator provided in `tools/validation.xlsx`.

## Submission Instructions
1. Complete your calculations.
2. Compare your results with the **Solutions** file or use the Excel validator for feedback.
3. Ensure all required fields are completed before moving on to the next task.

## Tips for Subnetting
- Use **CIDR notation** to assign subnet masks.
- Always account for 2 IPs (network address and broadcast address) that cannot be used for devices.
- Start with the largest subnet requirement and work your way down.
