## Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of IP subnetting and networking concepts.
- A text editor or IDE for working with markdown files.
- Microsoft Excel or a compatible program to use the validator spreadsheet.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Complete the Tasks
Navigate to the `tasks/` directory and open the markdown files (e.g., `Task1.md`). Follow the instructions provided for each task.

### Step 2: Validate Your Work
- After completing a task, cross-check your results with the corresponding solution file in the `solutions/` directory (e.g., `Task1_solution.md`).
- Alternatively, use the `validator/validation.xlsx` spreadsheet for automated feedback. Enter your results in the provided fields, and the validation logic will indicate whether your answers are correct.

### Step 3: Iterate and Improve
If your answers are incorrect, review your calculations and try again. The solutions and validator are here to guide you!

## Task Example
### Task 1: Subnetting
- **Base Network:** `192.168.50.0/24`
- **Requirements:** Divide the network into subnets for HR, IT, Sales, and Guest departments. Refer to `tasks/Task1.md` for details.
